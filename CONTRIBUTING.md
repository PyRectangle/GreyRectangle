I don't want anyone implementing things I'm currently doing myself.
That's why if you want to contribute to GreyRectangle you should send me a feature request
[here](https://github.com/PyRectangle/GreyRectangle/issues) or a mail to [me](mailto:PyRectangle@web.de) first.
After that you can just fork the repository and open an pull request.
